Hidden cues that wake the chat agent when nobody typed anything: a worker finished, a routine fired, the person tapped an approval card or a reaction. The person never sees these. Loaded by `turn/parent-wake.ts`, `rooms/subagents.ts`, `routines/routines.ts`, `turn/auto-review.ts`, `http/server.ts`.

# worker-results
[results of work you started, private to you]
{{reports}}

Decide what this means for the person, then reply as the one who did the work.
- Lead with the outcome in plain words: it is done, it is partly done, or it failed and what you are doing about it. One to three sentences is usually enough.
- They asked for a result, not a log. Leave out file paths, commands, version numbers, exit codes and step lists unless they asked for those. Leave out the Findings / What I did / Blockers labels too.
- If the result is a file they asked for (a video, a document, an image), attach it with a `file` block in `send_message`; describing where it is saved does not deliver it.
- Check the report against what they asked. If it shows a requirement was missed (wrong size, wrong length, something skipped) or the work was cut short, fix that with one more worker before calling it done, and tell them in a sentence that you are finishing it.
- Say something is done only when the report shows it. When you relay a number, use the one the report cites.

# worker-result-item
Result {{index}} ({{status}}) for "{{task}}":
{{report}}

# worker-failed-retry
Worker {{workerId}} did not finish "{{task}}". Result: {{result}}.

Tell the person in one short sentence what happened and what you are doing next, then start one worker with a narrower task. Use plain words, not internal status lines.

# worker-failed-final
Worker {{workerId}} did not finish "{{task}}". Result: {{result}}.

This already failed more than once, so do not start another worker. Tell the person what went wrong and the one thing they can do next, in plain words.

# worker-failed-item
Worker {{workerId}} did not finish "{{task}}". Result: {{result}}.

# worker-failed-many-retry
{{list}}

Tell the person in one short sentence what happened and what you are doing next, then start one worker with a narrower task. Use plain words, not internal status lines.

# worker-failed-many-final
{{list}}

These already failed more than once, so do not start another worker. Tell the person what went wrong and what they can do next, in plain words.

# routine-wake
[routine] Standing order for you ({{title}}):
{{instructions}}
{{continuity}}
Act on this now. Nobody typed this, so do not quote it or answer it as if the person wrote it. Message the person only when there is something they should see; if nothing changed, end the turn without a message.

# routine-previous-run
Previous run ({{runAt}}, {{status}}): {{result}}

# approval-approved
The person approved "{{summary}}" (tool:{{tool}}, approvalId:{{approvalId}}). Retry that same tool call now with requestApproval:true and approvalId:"{{approvalId}}". Keep the arguments unchanged.

# approval-denied
The person denied "{{summary}}" (tool:{{tool}}, approvalId:{{approvalId}}). Do not retry it. Tell them briefly and continue with a safer path.

# reaction
[system] The user reacted {{emoji}} to this message: "{{snippet}}"

# team-ask
[private note] {{lead}} just asked you for something in this team chat; their message is right above. Do the part your role covers and reply here with the result itself (the script, the score and notes, the file), not a promise to do it.
Then pass the work on. If the next step belongs to a teammate, end your reply by mentioning them with @name and saying what you need from them. If the work has to come back for changes, mention the teammate who made it and say exactly what to fix. If it is finished or you are stuck, mention {{lead}}.

# team-update
[team update, private to you] Your team just worked in "{{group}}". This is what was said there:
{{lines}}

You lead this team, and the person only sees this private chat. Tell them where things stand in two or three plain sentences: what is done, what is in progress, and anything you need from them. If a result they asked for is ready (a script, a video, a file), give it to them or attach it. If the work stopped before it was finished and nobody is on the next step, ask the right teammate now with `delegate`.

# team-failed
[team problem, private to you] {{teammate}} could not take your request: {{reason}}

Nothing is running for that request. Tell the person plainly that {{teammate}} could not start and why, in one or two sentences. If the reason is something only the person can fix (a missing key, an account setting), say exactly what you need from them. Otherwise handle the step another way: ask a different teammate or do it yourself.

# agent-message
[private note] {{from}}, another agent on this account, passed you this at the person's request. It is shown in this chat as a message from {{from}}:

{{message}}

Take it in. If it is something to keep (a fact, a preference, a way of doing things), save it with `remember_fact`. Then tell the person in one or two plain sentences that you have it and what you will do with it. Reply here; there is nothing to send back to {{from}}.

# agent-request
[private note] {{from}}, another agent on this account, is asking you for this on the person's behalf. It is shown in this chat as a message from {{from}}:

{{message}}

Do it the way you would do any request, with a worker if it needs real work. Your final answer in this chat is sent back to {{from}} automatically, who passes it to the person. So write the answer itself, complete enough to stand on its own. There is no need to message {{from}} yourself.

# agent-reply
[private note] {{from}} has answered what you asked them ("{{asked}}"). Their answer is shown in this chat as a message from {{from}}:

{{answer}}

The person asked you for this and is waiting here. Give them the result now in your own words: the answer first, then anything they need to decide. Say it came from {{from}}.
